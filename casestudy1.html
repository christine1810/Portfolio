    <div class="right"><h2>The Brief</h2>
        <p>We were tasked to create a travel app which we would design and prototype.

        <p>Market Research - What else is out there?

        I began my research by looking at apps that already exist in the market, my findings were as follows:

        No apps like this excist for Belfast. 
        The apps I did find were for parts of England or America.
        I felt these apps were missing something visually,
        using only photos.
        Too much information on venue pages not enough visual aspects to the other apps.
        </p>

    <div class="right"><h2>Understanding the 
        Problem</h2>
        <p><b>How can I improve what already excists?</b><br>
        By creating a better experience for the user, one that is more asthetically pleasing, and providing the exact information the need and not over crowding content on the app.
        </p>
        <br>

     <div class="right"><h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>The idea was to design a mobile app to provide travellers with local happy hour information, and to create some beautiful illustrations of drinks and venues giving my application an artistic and creative twist in comparisson to thoses already on the market.
        <br>

            <b>What information will I include?</b><br>
        I decided to have a short paragraph accompaning each venue then a list of offeres and times accompanying the drink illustration on the drink offers page.

    <div class="right"><h2>Challenges Met</h2>
        <p>I had never used Sketch or any other software for that matter to illustrate images, im am used to paper and pencil or paint and a paintbrush! however I buckeled down, and taught myself.</p>

     <div class="right"><h2>More Challenges Met</h2>
        <p>I had also never used invision but I was able to create prototypes of my app by again teachin myself.</p>

    <div class="right"><h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>I feel the end product turned out well, and I achieved what I set out to do. I will definetly come back to this project in the future continue to develop it.</p>

    <div class="right"><h2>Result</h2>
        <p>If I were to start this project over I would dig a bit deeper in regards to research by maybe creating user surveys/questionaires. I would take more time to get to know my customer, time was limited given this was a university project.</p>
